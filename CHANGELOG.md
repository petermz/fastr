# 20.3.0

Bug fixes:

* Set internal generic dispatch for the lengths builtin, #164

New features:

* preliminary implementation of the ALTREP framework
  * support for registering custom ALTREP classes
  * ALTREP specific C API, e.g., `INTEGER_IS_SORTED`
  * serialization and deserialization of custom ALTREP objects is not supported yet

Added missing R builtins and C APIs:

* non-API C function match5, which is used by some packages
* non-API C function `match5`, which is used by some packages (#149)
* define dummy `XLENGTH` macro if `USE_RINTERNALS` is defined
  * non-existence of this macro is used by some packages to detect old R versions
* `IS_LONG_VEC` C API function
* when loading native symbol dynamically, FastR also checks the name with trailing underscode to be compatible with GNU-R

# 20.2.0

Bug fixes:

* FastR cleans-up the temporary directory created for internal implementation of the R input handlers
* Improve performance of `unique` #154

Added missing R builtins and C APIs

* Dummy implementations of `X_IS_SORTED` and `X_NO_NA` for `X = STRING,INTEGER,REAL` #156

# 20.1.0

New features:

* Preview of improved graphical support.
  * Use `--R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false` to activate this feature.
  * `graphics` and `grDevices` packages are implemented by incorporating the `JavaGD` package.
  * The standard `grid` package works out of the box as well as `lattice` and `ggplot2`.
  * Supported image formats: PDF, PNG, JPEG, BMP.
  * SVG support will be added in the future.
  * Display lists are fully implemented, which, e.g., makes Shiny work better in FastR.
  * Custom FastR `grid` package implementation, which is currently the default, will be deprecated and removed in future releases.
* FastR ships with GCC runtime libraries on all supported systems (Linux and MacOS).
  * GFortran is not a requirement anymore to run FastR, but it is still required to install R packages with Fortran code
  * The GFortran runtime libraries versions are 4.8.5 on Linux and 8.3.0 on MacOS. When compiling additional R packages with Fortran code, one must use GFortran of the same or higher version.
* GFortran is used as the default Fortran compiler even in the "LLVM" toolchain configuration.
  * R packages that contain Fortran code will not be runnable on
  the FastR's LLVM backend (`--R.BackEnd=llvm`). However, the default backend is
  the "native" (`--R.BackEnd=native`). One can also choose to run only specific packages
  via the LLVM backend (`--R.BackEndLLVM=mypackage`).
  * Users can switch back to F2C, which can produce libraries runnable on the LLVM backend,
  by editing variable `FC` in `{FASTR_HOME}/etc/Makeconf`.
* print stacktraces (in `traceback()`) for errors coming from C/C++ code when FastR is running in the LLVM mode (`--R.BackEnd=llvm`) and errors coming from other languages, e.g., GraalPython.
* `@` can be also used to access members of polyglot values originating from other languages. This was previously possible only with `$`, now both operators work.

Bug fixes:

* S3 dispatch with missing arguments, e.g., `as_tibble()` (reported by Michael Hall on Slack)
* `dyn.load` did not work with relative paths
* missing warnings on integer overflow #136
* the f2c script fixed to handle extra dotted file extensions #143
* `iconv` honors the `from` and `asRaw` parameters. Fixes, e.g.: `iconv('foo²²', 'UTF8', 'latin1')`

# 20.0.0

New features:

* clean-up of the `Makeconf` files shipped with FastR in the `etc` directory:
  * `Makeconf.llvm` makes use of the newly available tools in the Labs LLVM Toolchain (`ar` and `ranlib`)
  * `Makeconf.native` contains only generic configuration for Linux/MacOS (with GCC toolchain installed)
  * both files recognize following environment variables:
    * `PKG_LDFLAGS_OVERRIDE` intended for adding library directories for the linker, but may contain any linker flags, e.g., `-L/path/to/library/which/is/not/in/my/os/default/search/path`
    * `PKG_INCLUDE_FLAGS_OVERRIDE` intended for addding include directories, but may contain any compiler flags
    * Note: `Makeconf.llvm` is also used as the default `Makeconf` file, you can change that by using `fastr.setToolchain('native')` (not a new feature in this release)
    * Note: instead of exporting `PKG_LDFLAGS_OVERRIDE` or `PKG_INCLUDE_FLAGS_OVERRIDE`, you can also edit the Makeconf file
* implement the "parse with named arguments" Truffle API available to Truffle instruments
* use the `RootBodyTag` to tag function bodies for Truffle instrumentation

Added missing R builtins and C APIs

* subsetting an array by numeric/string matrix
* ported all external C functions used by `nlm` (#100) and `fisher.test` from the `stats` base package
* Rf_asS4 C API function #118
* `serializeInfoFromConn` and `loadInfoFromConn2` internal builtins

Bug fixes:

* fixed: `polyglot.value` is not an object #123
  * `polyglot.value` is now treated as explicit and not implicit class
  * one of the implications is that internal generic dispatch works with `polyglot.value` #122
* can't assign class to polyglot value #124
* incorrect formatting for sprintf %g and %G: trailing zeroes #126
* support for remote workers with fastRCluster package #113
* bug in variable lookup when a package removes one of its variables using `rm` during `.onLoad`
* Rf_eval: when the argument is a pair-list do not execute it like a language object
* fixed cross-product (`%*%`) for scalar complex values
* fixed `dirname('.')` and `dirname('/')` to give `'.'` and `'/'`
* `list2env` handles duplicated elements correctly
* properly propagate exit code from the launchers (`R` and `Rscript`)


# 19.3.0

New features:

* FastR is based on R 3.6.1
* GCC runtime libraries are not shipped with FastR, use the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:
    * Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04: `apt-get install libgfortran3 libgomp1`
    * Oracle Linux 7: `yum install libgfortran libgomp`
    * Oracle Linux 8: `yum install compat-libgfortran-48`
    * MacOS: `brew install gcc@4.9`
* new Graal LLVM based back-end for running packages native code.
  * The default {FASTR_HOME}/etc/Makeconf is configured to use the Graal LLVM toolchain to build the native code of R packages.
    * The toolchain builds standard native binaries for a given plarform and also embeds the corresponding LLVM bitcode in them.
    * R builtin `fastr.setToolchain(name)` (`name` can be `llvm` or `native`) sets the compiler toolchain used for package building (modifies etc/Makeconf).
    * To switch back to the previous toolchain configuration that used `GCC`, execute `fastr.setToolchain("native")`.
  * Option `--R.BackEnd` specifies the default backend used to execute packages native code.
    * Different R packages can be run via different backends in one FastR context.
    * `--R.BackEnd=native`, the default, is JNI based backend that runs directly the actual native code.
    * `--R.BackEnd=llvm` is the new LLVM backend that loads the LLVM bitcode embedded in package libraries and runs it via Graal LLVM.
    * `--R.BackEndNative=pkg1,pkg2,...` enumerates packages whose native code will be executed by the native backend.
    * `--R.BackEndLLVM=pkg1,pkg2,...` enumerates packages whose native code will be executed by the LLVM backend.
    * Note: All `--R.BackEnd*` options are passed to R subprocesses.
  * Debugging of packages native code with LLVM backend.
    * Option `--R.DebugLLVMLibs` activates debugging of native code using the bundled LLVM bitcode.
    * Builtin `fastr.useDebugMakevars(use)` activates/deactivates a special `etc/Makevars.site` tailored for building the packages native code for debugging.
* `gc` attempts to invoke Java GC when FastR is run with `--R.EnableExplicitGC=true`
  * this is intended only for testing purposes and it is not recommended to run GC explicitly in FastR.
  * `gc` is not invoking Java GC by default because GNU-R GC and Java GC are fundamentally
    different and this may lead to unintended behavior.

Added missing R builtins and C APIs

* `gctorture` and `gctorture2` built-ins for testing purposes
* `grepRaw` (only for `fixed=T`)

* `for` loop creates and initializes the control variable even if there are no iterations #77
* update the output of the `capabilities` builtin #78

# 19.0.0

  * see the changes in the [spec tests](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/commit/e08e2b19571479dddb6167d9a1d492a14cb4c7b2#diff-c842fa11097793b19bd410589c36af99)

Added missing R builtins and C APIs

* simple support for the weak reference API functions (`R_MakeWeakRef`, `R_MakeWeakRefC`, `R_WeakRefKey`, `R_WeakRefValue`)
* `Rf_i1mach`
* `gzcon` builtin for `url` connections, e.g., `load(url('protocol://path'))` should work now
* `Sys.localeconv` supports: `decimal_point`, `thousands_sep`, `grouping`, `int_curr_symbol`, `currency_symbol`, `mon_decimal_point`,
  `mon_thousands_sep`, `mon_grouping`, `int_frac_digits`, `p_cs_precedes`, other fields are fixed to some meaningful but not culture
  sensitive value for given field

* all FastR specific options (NOT those GNU-R compatible like `--save`) are experimental except for `--R.PrintErrorStacktracesToFile`,
which is an option that enables logging of FastR internal errors for bug reporting purposes. Experimental options can be unlocked
using `--experimental-options` or with `ContextBuilder#allowExperimentalOptions`.
* the MRAN mirror used by FastR by default instead of CRAN was bumped to 2019-02-13
* options for the JVM or native image are now passed using `--vm.` prefix in both cases instead of `--jvm.` or `--native.`
(e.g., `--jvm.Dproperty=false` becomes `--vm.Dproperty=false`)

New features:

* whenever possible, errors are propagated to the FastR embedder

Added missing R builtins and C API

* `Rf_StringBlank`

Bug fixes:

* `C_numeric_deriv` gives wrong results of gradient #54
* `tcrossprod` with a single vector #56
* `length<-` would remove attributes from the target even if it was a shared value
* `length(x) <- N` should not strip attributes if `length(x) == N`, which is not in line with GNU-R documentation,
but relied upon in the `methods` package #55
* `as.Date` with invalid date string #56

# 1.0 RC 13

New features:

* new JUL-like logging infrastructure backed by Truffle
* FastR options backed by Truffle now. New command-line format - i.e. bin/r --R.PerformanceWarning="true". Also configurable via org.graal.polyglot.Context.Builder.
* script configure_fastr also regenerates etc/Renviron and etc/ldpaths
* FastR vectors are not writeable from other languages

Bug fixes:

* `sys.calls` gives wrong result when `eval` with `envir` argument is on the call stack
* `is.na` was not correctly handling lists, for example: `is.na(list(function() 42))`
* transfer `srcref` attribute to the result of `.subset` and `[`
* `matrix(1,nrow=NULL,ncol=NULL)` caused internal FastR error instead of R user level error
* option `--polyglot` works with the native image of FastR
* added native functions optim() and optimness()
* fixed various race conditions in parallel package

* `switch` falls through only if the actual argument is empty constant: `switch('x',x=,y=42)` vs. `switch('x',x=quote(f(1,))[[3]],y=42)`
* `oldClass<-` works with external pointers and other less common R types
* C API function `Rf_setAttrib` coerces double vector to integer when setting "dim" attribute #46

# 1.0 RC 10

New features:

* interop and tooling: READ and WRITE of ActiveBinding may have side effects. This is communicated via `KEY_INFO` to the tools and other languages (e.g., a debugger may warn before evaluating an ActiveBinding)
* the MRAN mirror used by FastR as default repo was moved to https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-06-20

* Various fixes necessary to pass dplyr tests (GitHub version of dplyr)

Bugfixes

# 1.0 RC 6

New features

* Support for reading/writing graphical parameters via par
  * in preparation for full graphics package support

# 1.0 RC 5

New features

* Script that configures FastR for the current system (jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr)
  * allows to pass additional arguments for the underlying configure script
  * by default uses the following arguments: --with-x=no --with-aqua=no --enable-memory-profiling FFLAGS=-O2

Updates in interop

* R code evaluated via interop never returns a Java primitive type, but always a vector
* Vectors of size 1 that do not contain NA can be unboxed
* Sending the READ message to an atomic R vector (array subscript in most languages) gives
  * Java primitive type as long as the value is not `NA`
  * if the value is `NA`, a special value that responds to `IS_NULL` with `true`. If this value is passed back to R it behaves as `NA` again
* Note that sending the READ message to a list, environment, or other heterogenous data structure never gives atomic Java type but a primitive R vector

Bug fixes

* Various smaller issues discovered during testing of CRAN packages.

# 1.0 RC 4

# 1.0 RC 3

Added missing R builtins and C API
