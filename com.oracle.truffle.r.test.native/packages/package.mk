# This "builds" a test package, resulting in a tar file,
# which is then loaded by the unit tests in TestRPackages.
# It uses R CMD build ...
# Currently we can't use FastR for this step as FastR isn't completely built
# when this is built (it's part of the build)
# The resulting package is stored in the "repo/src/contrib" folder

# test packages may include .Rin files that are preprocessed to create an
# actual test file. Unfortunately while R CND check will do this, tools::testInstalledPackage
# does not (surely a bug). So we generate the files here.
